# 📚 Rust Learning Repository

This repository is my personal journey of learning the **Rust programming language**.
I follow along with the official [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and write code examples, adding **important notes and explanations as comments**.

The goal is simple:

- ✅ Strengthen my understanding by coding along.
- ✅ Maintain clear explanations and summaries alongside code.
- ✅ Encourage others to read the Rust Book for deeper insights.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each chapter or concept from the Rust Book has:

- **Code examples** → written and tested while learning.
- **Commented notes** → key takeaways, clarifications, and gotchas.
- **Summary** → quick reference for revision.
